/*

Inspired by SparkFun Inventorâ€™s Kit, Circuit 1D-RGB Nightlight, starter code written by Sparkfun.

Turns an RGB LED on or off based on the light level read by a photoresistor.
Change colors by turning the potentiometer.

Modifications are my own - I wanted to expirement with a blinking LED and also a pulsing LED.
